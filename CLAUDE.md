## AI Team Structure

### Overview

This project uses a **multi-agent AI team approach** where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of development. As the Product Manager, you orchestrate these agents to build the platform efficiently.

**Team Model**: 1 Product Manager (Human) + 7 AI Agents (Claude Code)

### The AI Team

| Role | Slash Command | Expertise | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Frontend Developer** | `/frontend-dev` | Flutter, Dart, Riverpod | Build screens, widgets, state management, API integration |
| **Backend Developer** | `/backend-dev` | Node.js, TypeScript, Lambda, DynamoDB | Build Lambda functions, DynamoDB operations, AWS integrations |
| **System Architect** | `/architect` | System design, data modeling, AWS architecture | Make architecture decisions, design schemas, write ADRs |
| **DevOps Engineer** | `/devops` | CI/CD, deployments, infrastructure | Set up pipelines, deploy to AWS, monitor infrastructure |
| **Functional QA** | `/qa-functional` | Testing, bug reporting | Test features, report bugs, verify user flows |
| **Performance QA** | `/qa-performance` | Performance testing, cost optimization | Profile Lambdas, optimize costs, load testing |
| **Project Manager** | `/pm` | Task coordination, progress tracking | Break down tasks, assign work, track progress |

### How It Works

1. **You (Product Manager)** define requirements and make final decisions
2. **Project Manager Agent** (`/pm`) breaks down work into tasks
3. **Specialized Agents** execute tasks in their domain
4. **QA Agents** verify quality before deployment
5. **DevOps Agent** deploys to AWS

### Usage Examples

#### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# As Product Manager, delegate to PM agent
/pm "Plan the user registration feature for Phase 1.
     Break down into tasks and assign to appropriate agents."

# PM agent will then delegate to:
# - /architect for schema design
# - /backend-dev for Lambda functions
# - /frontend-dev for UI screens
# - /qa-functional for testing
# - /devops for deployment
```

#### Direct Task Assignment

```bash
# Directly assign to specific agent
/backend-dev "Implement POST /messages Lambda function.
              Store messages in DynamoDB Messages table."

/frontend-dev "Build the chat screen with message bubbles,
               text input, and send button."

/architect "Design the DynamoDB schema for photo tagging.
            Users should be able to tag themselves and view tagged photos."
```

#### Quality Assurance

```bash
# Before committing code
/qa-functional "Test the SMS verification flow.
                Verify all edge cases."

/qa-performance "Profile the POST /messages Lambda.
                 Target: <300ms response time."
```

#### Infrastructure & Deployment

```bash
/devops "Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
         Deploy to dev on merge to develop branch."

/devops "Deploy the latest changes to staging environment."
```

### Agent Communication Flow

```
Product Manager (You)
        ↓
   Project Manager (/pm)
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┬─────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
   ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
Architect  Backend  Frontend  DevOps     QA Agents
        ↘      ↓         ↓          ↓      ↙
              Code Review & Testing
                      ↓
              Production Deployment
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Full Feature Development

```bash
1. /pm "Plan user registration feature"
   → Creates task breakdown

2. /architect "Design Users DynamoDB schema"
   → Updates ARCHITECTURE.md

3. /backend-dev "Implement registration Lambda"
   → Builds backend API

4. /frontend-dev "Build registration screen"
   → Builds UI

5. /qa-functional "Test registration flow"
   → Verifies functionality

6. /qa-performance "Check Lambda performance"
   → Optimizes if needed

7. /devops "Deploy to dev environment"
   → Deploys and monitors
```

#### Pattern 2: Architecture Decision

```bash
1. /architect "Should we use AppSync or API Gateway WebSocket
               for real-time messaging?"
   → Analyzes options, documents ADR

2. Product Manager decides based on recommendation

3. /architect "Update ARCHITECTURE.md with WebSocket decision"
   → Documents final decision
```

#### Pattern 3: Bug Fix

```bash
1. /qa-functional "Reports: SMS verification code not working"

2. /backend-dev "Debug SMS verification Lambda"
   → Identifies and fixes bug

3. /qa-functional "Verify SMS verification fix"
   → Regression testing

4. /devops "Deploy bug fix to production"
   → Hot fix deployment
```

### Best Practices

#### For Product Manager (You)

✅ **DO**:
- Start features with `/pm` for planning
- Review agent recommendations before approval
- Make final product decisions yourself
- Escalate technical vs product trade-offs to appropriate agent

❌ **DON'T**:
- Micromanage implementation details (trust the agents)
- Skip QA before deployment
- Make architecture decisions without `/architect` input

#### Agent Handoffs

- **Architect → Backend**: Schema design → implementation
- **Backend → Frontend**: API complete → UI integration
- **Development → QA**: Code complete → testing
- **QA → DevOps**: Tests pass → deployment

### Documentation

For detailed instructions on using each agent, see:
- **Quick Start**: `/docs/AI_TEAM_GUIDE.md`
- **Agent Definitions**: `/.claude/commands/*.md`

Each agent's slash command file (`.claude/commands/`) contains:
- Role definition and expertise
- Responsibilities and constraints
- Quality standards
- Escalation guidelines
- Example tasks

### Productivity Benefits

**Traditional Solo Development**:
- 1 person switches between all roles
- Context switching overhead
- Harder to maintain quality standards

**With AI Agent Team**:
- Specialized focus per agent
- Parallel task execution possible
- Consistent quality standards per domain
- Built-in code review (architecture, QA perspectives)
- Automated task tracking (TodoWrite tool)

### Next Steps

1. Read `/docs/AI_TEAM_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage guide
2. Try `/pm` to plan your first feature
3. Use `/architect` to review architecture decisions
4. Delegate implementation to `/backend-dev` and `/frontend-dev`
5. Quality-check with `/qa-functional` and `/qa-performance`
6. Deploy with `/devops`

---

## Coding Conventions

### General Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write code that's easy to understand
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract reusable logic
3. **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles
4. **Security First**: Never commit secrets, validate inputs, sanitize outputs

### Language-Specific Conventions

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Use meaningful variable names
const userData = fetchUser(userId);

// Prefer const/let over var
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
let currentAttempt = 0;

// Use async/await over callbacks
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.json();
}

// Document complex functions
/**
 * Calculates user engagement score based on activity metrics
 * @param {Object} metrics - User activity metrics
 * @returns {number} Engagement score (0-100)
 */
function calculateEngagement(metrics) {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Python
```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
def process_data(items: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
    """Process items and return frequency count."""
    return {item: items.count(item) for item in set(items)}

# Use context managers
with open('file.txt') as f:
    content = f.read()
```

### File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for files: `user-service.js`
- Use PascalCase for class files: `UserService.js`
- Use kebab-case for directories: `user-management/`

### Code Organization

- One class/component per file (when reasonable)
- Group related functionality into modules
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into helper functions

5. **constructs**: CDK constructs library

### Known Issues and Limitations

**Current Limitations** (to be resolved as project develops):
- WhatsApp Business API requires approval and has rate limits
- Lambda cold starts (1-2 seconds) - mitigated with provisioned concurrency for critical functions
- DynamoDB requires careful data modeling (no joins) - use single-table design patterns
- Cross-channel identity mapping complexity
- Real-time message synchronization across channels

**Technical Considerations**:
- SMS costs: AWS SNS charges ~$0.008-0.04 per international SMS
- WhatsApp Business API has strict templates for initial contact (24-hour session window)
- Lambda concurrent execution limits (1,000 default, can request increase)
- API Gateway timeout: 29 seconds max (Lambda max 15 minutes)
- DynamoDB item size limit: 400KB max
- S3 eventual consistency for new objects
- Need to handle message delivery failures gracefully with retry logic

**Cost Management**:
- Monitor DynamoDB capacity units closely (can spike with traffic)
- Use S3 lifecycle policies to archive old photos to Glacier
- Implement CloudWatch alarms for unexpected cost increases
- Consider Reserved Capacity for DynamoDB if usage becomes predictable

### Project-Specific Security Requirements

**Critical Security Measures**:
1. **Phone Number Verification**: Mandatory SMS verification for all users
2. **Peer Approval**: New users require approval from existing members
3. **PII Protection**: Real names and phone numbers must be encrypted at rest
4. **Channel Security**:
   - End-to-end encryption for in-app messages
   - Secure storage of API credentials
   - Token rotation for external services
5. **Privacy Controls**: Users control who sees their contact info
6. **Audit Logging**: Track all cross-channel message routing
7. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
8. **GDPR Compliance**: User data export and deletion capabilities

**Never Commit**:
- AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys
- AWS Secrets Manager secret values
- Twilio API keys (for WhatsApp)
- JWT secret keys
- Any user data, phone numbers, or email addresses
- `.env` files with sensitive values
- CloudFormation stack outputs with sensitive data

**Use AWS Secrets Manager for**:
- JWT signing secrets
- WhatsApp API credentials
- Third-party API keys
- Database connection strings (if any)

### Architecture Decisions

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** should be stored in `/docs/adr/`:

- ADR-001: Cross-platform mobile framework selection (Flutter) - ✅ Decided
- ADR-002: Serverless architecture vs containers (Serverless) - ✅ Decided
- ADR-003: Backend language selection (Node.js/TypeScript) - ✅ Decided
- ADR-004: Database choice (DynamoDB over PostgreSQL) - ✅ Decided
  - **Rationale**: Cost savings (9x cheaper), true serverless, perfect for sporadic usage
- ADR-005: SMS provider (AWS SNS over Twilio) - ✅ Decided
  - **Rationale**: 50-80% cheaper for international SMS (Hong Kong + worldwide)
- ADR-006: Multi-channel messaging architecture
- ADR-007: User verification and peer approval workflow
- ADR-008: Photo tagging and recognition system
- ADR-009: Multi-classroom tracking data model
- ADR-010: Real-time messaging (AppSync vs WebSocket)
- ADR-011: Infrastructure deployment tool (AWS CDK over Serverless Framework) - ✅ Decided
  - **Rationale**: TypeScript consistency, type safety, official AWS tool, better for complex features

## Notes for AI Assistants

### Context Gathering

Before making changes:
1. Read related files to understand context
2. Check for existing tests
3. Look for similar patterns in the codebase
4. Review recent commits for context

### Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand**: Clarify requirements and constraints
2. **Plan**: Break down into manageable tasks (use TodoWrite)
3. **Implement**: Write clean, tested code
4. **Verify**: Ensure tests pass and no regressions
5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Commit**: Use clear commit messages
7. **Push**: To the correct branch

### When Uncertain

- Ask the user for clarification
- Check existing code for established patterns
- Prefer conservative changes over risky ones
- Document assumptions made
